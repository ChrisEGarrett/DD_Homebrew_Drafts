Most classes, homebrew or not, have a set of Archetypes that help nudge a character along in a specific style. Some add new mechanics to a class, some improve existing mechanics, and some take mechanics from other classes (albeit weakened, such as with spellcasting) and bring them over.

With Archetypes, keep in mind that while they're important to the class as a whole, you need to focus on keeping yours from being too powerful or too weak so that a mixed amount of people will want to use it.
