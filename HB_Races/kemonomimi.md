#Kemonomimi

Kemonomimi are members of a family of distinct races, bound by their shared characteristic, animal-like ears and tails.  The animal that a kemonomimi family resembles is considered to be that family's 'patron'.

While kemonomimi are varied in type, they generally keep the basic traits of the animal they resemble (i.e., a dog kemonomimi may be more loyal).

##Habitat
Kemonomimi are found in roughly the same places as humans, with hardier families existing somewhat outside normal human habitation.  For example, arctic wolf kemonomimi may reside in snowier or colder lands than humans.

##Age
Kemonomimi have approximately the same lifespan as humans, but those related to long-living animals may live somewhat longer.

##Culture
Kemonomimi are generally human-like in their culture, and frequently integrate into larger humanoid communities without much difficulty.  However, some families have issues integrating due to their nature.

##Alignment
Depending on their patron, kemonomimi tend toward different alignments. 

| Patron Animal | Natural Alignment    |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Cat           | Chaotic Neutral/Evil |
| Dog           | Lawful Good/Neutral  |
| Mouse         | True Neutral         |
| Bear          | Chaotic Good         |
| Cow           | Neutral Good         |
| Ferret        | Chaotic Neutral/Evil |
| Fox           | Chaotic Neutral      |

This is not an exhaustive list; when creating a kemonomimi, consider the common characteristics of the patron animal.
